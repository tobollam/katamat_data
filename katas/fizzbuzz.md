# FizzBuzz

The FizzBuzz kata is based on a game for children, to teach them about division. 

## Task

- prints one line for each number from 1 to 100
- usually prints the number itself
- for multiples of 3 print "Fizz" instead of the number
- for multiples of 5 print "Buzz" instead of the number
- for numbers which are multiples of 3 and 5 print FizzBuzz instead of the number
